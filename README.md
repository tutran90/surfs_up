# **Surfs Up**

## **Overview of the Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis was to help the client (W.Avy) determine if it will be a profitable investment to open a surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu. The analysis was conducted using Python and SQLAlchemy. 

## **Results** 

The following ![image](https://github.com/tutran90/surfs_up/blob/main/June%20Statistics.png) shows the statistcal analysis for the months of June and ![image](https://github.com/tutran90/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec.%20Statistics.png) for December. 

Differences: 
- There were more entries for the month of June (1700) compared to December (1517). This can be due to Holiday closures during the month of December 
- December is slightly cooler than June with the min temperature of 56 where as June's minimum temperature is 64. 
- The average temperature for both months are slightly different with June at 75 and December at 71. 

## **Summary** 

As mentioned above, June had slightly more data compared to December which can be due to Holiday closures occuring during the month of December. However, it would be benefical to perform additional queries on top of the temperature and precipitation in order to gain more understanding of the market. 

Overall, the temperature for both months are comparable. It would be more beneficial to compare the active stations for each month and look at the sales record. The temperature during the winter does note appear to change dramatically as can be seen in the month of December. To gain a better picture of what the market is like another query could be conducted to compare all the winter months (Dec-Feb) and the summer months (May-Aug) and the sales conducted during those months. I believe this would give the client a better picture on whether or not the business will be sustainable all year-round.
